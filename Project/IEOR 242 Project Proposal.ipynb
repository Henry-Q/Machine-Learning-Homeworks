    "# **Project Proposal: Data Analysis on Factors Influencing an Individual's Alcohol Tolerance**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **The Problem:**\n",
    "We aim to uncover the key factors that determine how much alcohol an individual can consume (e.g., the number of shots) before showing signs of intoxication.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Collection:**\n",
    "We will collect data from 1,000 respondents via surveys. The survey will include questions about:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Demographic Information:**\n",
    "  - Age\n",
    "  - Gender\n",
    "  - Weight\n",
    "  - etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Drinking Habits:**\n",
    "  - Frequency\n",
    "  - Typical consumption amount\n",
    "  - etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Health-Related Questions:**\n",
    "  - Liver conditions\n",
    "  - Medication\n",
    "  - etc.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Emotional and Psychological State**\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Genetic Predisposition:**\n",
    "  - Family history of alcohol tolerance\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Dietary Habits Before Drinking**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Type and Strength of Alcohol Typically Consumed**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Techniques to be Used:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Random Forests:** \n",
    "  - This will allow us to use an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions about alcohol tolerance based on the collected data. The method is highly flexible and can handle nonlinear relationships well.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Classification:** \n",
    "  - Given the data, we will classify individuals into different alcohol tolerance categories. For instance, categories could range from \"low tolerance\" to \"high tolerance\".\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Cross Validation:** \n",
    "  - To ensure that our model is robust and not just fitting to our specific sample, we will use cross-validation. This will give us a better understanding of how our model will perform on unseen data and help in tuning the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Impact or Overall Goal of the Project:**\n",
    "\n",
    "With a well-developed model:\n",
    "- We can provide more personalized recommendations for individuals regarding safe alcohol consumption.\n",
    "- Bars and restaurants can use this information to serve customers more responsibly.\n",
    "- Health organizations can better understand the dynamics of alcohol consumption and potentially develop more effective awareness campaigns.\n",
    "- This could also assist in medical contexts, where understanding a patient's alcohol tolerance might be crucial for treatments or interventions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**In conclusion,** by analyzing the factors that influence an individual's alcohol tolerance, we not only gain a deeper understanding of the biology and sociology behind drinking but also pave the way for more responsible and informed alcohol consumption in society.\n",
